<p>We’re building the best SaaS product guidance app and need your help with the frontend!</p>

<p>Join our awesome <a href="/team">team</a> as we scale up our tech team.
We are in a phase where we know what to build, have a ton of ideas, interesting portfolio of clients and an ambition to scale our business through automated self-served channels such as Shopify.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>opportunity to do things the way you want, to learn a lot</strong>, and to be part of the formative period of our company.
If you help us to make it, there’s a lot in it for you as well. <strong>There is a challenge here waiting for you.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-we-do">What we do</h2>

  <li>Use our custom AI tech to build guidance flows tailored to their products.</li>

  <li>Build intuitive UX based on designs from our designer.</li>
  <li>Participate on product decisions during early phases of dev process - we are not a <a href="https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory">feature factory</a>.</li>
  <li>Pair-program and review code with <a href="/team#franta">Franta</a> so that you can learn from each other.</li>

  <li>Backend: Symfony/Tailwind for the self-service onboarding process.</li>
  <li>Tools: Git, GitHub, Vercel (SPA hosting), Sentry (monitoring), shell scripts (task automation).</li>
</ul>

<p>We prioritize quality through code reviews, pair programming, and trunk-based development. We favor experimentation, small working increments, and big-picture thinking. Agile, but not Scrum.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-expect-from-you">What we expect from you</h2>

<p>We want a valuable and engaged team member who aligns with Outfindo’s mission and values. You need to feel what value we provide as a company.</p>

<p>You should be</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborative, working closely with teammates to solve problems and deliver value.</li>
  <li>Proactive, participating in discussions and offering thoughtful feedback.</li>
  <li>Flexible and ready to take ownership of tasks as priorities evolve.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have quite a bit of tech experience as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintaining a React SPA, including architecture, API integration, SSR, data models and performance optimization.</li>
  <li>Building components with an eye for design and UX.</li>
  <li>Translating mockups into responsive, intuitive interfaces.</li>
  <li>Analyzing problems, breaking them into manageable tasks, and proposing solutions.</li>
  <li>Writing maintainable code and improving the development process.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re looking for someone with at least 5 years of experience who thrives on teamwork, effectiveness, and delivering real value.</p>

<p>We will get along if we share these team values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our team is open-minded, inclusive, passionate.</li>
  <li>We help and trust each other to do our best work.</li>
  <li>We are always learning and trying to stay ahead.</li>
  <li>We respect and listen to each another.</li>
  <li>Creativity, passion, ambition and Outfindo goals drive us forward. We depend on each other’s reliability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some tasks or topics you might dive into when you join us:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing the app to deliver the best UX for our customers.</li>
  <li>Maintaining the design system, component library, and style guide.</li>
  <li>Improving data models and tightening integration with tools like OpenAPI specs.</li>
  <li>Managing quality by, for example, setting up automated tests.</li>
  <li>Implementing feature-toggle-based architecture.</li>
  <li>Enhancing our processes through Dockerization, GitHub Actions CI pipelines, and better monitoring.</li>
  <li>Optimizing performance, accessibility, and SEO.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-we-offer">What we offer</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Money - not garage-startup money, not corporate-level money either, but we want you to be comfortable.</li>
  <li>Bonuses tied to KPIs.</li>
  <li>Stock options: Share in Outfindo’s success.</li>
  <li>Support and mentoring: We’re here to help you succeed.</li>
  <li>Knowledge-sharing: Regular sessions to learn from and with your team.</li>
  <li>Stress-free environment.</li>
  <li>Monthly team events: biking in summer, climbing in winter, off-sites once or twice a year</li>
</ul>

<p>We are based in Prague with office in Žižkov.
Remote work is alright, but we prefer to see each other regularly to be effective and have some fun. Communication is the key.
We have good-enough office, we make good filtered coffee and we love cookies.</p>

<p><strong>If this resonates with you let us know - even if you are not sure about some of this stuff or about yourself. We are ready to help you if you want to work with us.</strong></p>
