**TL;DR**
**We want you with your experience to take care of our data processes, internal tools and primary data structure. Non-boring, actaully usefull, satisfying work with creative freedom. We will get you challenge, opportunity and help. We believe we are a great team, there is no stress, good money and/or stock options. We write maintanable code and architecture and stable infrastructure.**

We have a reasonable data team already. We build ETL pipelines in Airflow, use AI/ML in all aspects of our work. But there is still a lot to do to connect all the components and make the processes work for the company to benefit from them.

Join our awesome [team]({{ site.baseurl }}/team)!
The infant hacky years of Outfindo are over, we are sure about what we need to build now.

This is an **opportunity to do things the way you want, to learn a lot**, and to be part of the formative period of our company.
If you help us to make it, there's a lot in it for you as well. **There is a challenge here waiting for you.**

## What we do

Outfindo guides a customer through the process of choosing a complex product, be it a bike or a washing machine. We know all the products and we know where to buy it. We
* build a product catalog from various sources, automating the whole process using AI
* enhance the data to gain insight, using large language models
* get availability data from shops/eshops and match them with our catalog using ML
* build a guide that helps the end-customers and embed that into our partners' websites
* actively research and prototype new and fun ways of assistance for the customer to get product insight
See [outfindo.com](https://outfindo.com).

The company just got money in and is set for the next phase. Read about us here:

## What will you do

* take care of our primary data structures, ETL pipelines and components
* optimize processes, automate, integrate
* think out-of-the box about how to make things smarter!
* maintain infrastructure - linux servers, Postgre DB etc.

**It may sound a little boring, but actually I think it is anything but! When you invest your energy into the right thing, you can finish your work in the afternoon with immediate results helping our customers.** Which is satisifying, or always has been for me.

## How we do it

We use this tech:
* PostgreSQL 15 database, mixed relational/non-relational approach (json)
* Python 3.11, Scrapy, Numpy, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Polars, Seaborn, Jupyter notebook
* Airflow, Linux-based servers, Docker, automated CI/CD

We test using Pytest, do code reviews or pair-programming, champion trunk-based development. Divide and conquer - make small things work as fast as possible. Think about the bigger picture. We do a lot of experiments to confirm hypotheses. When successful, we integrate the proof-of-concept into existing processes. We are agile, and by that I do not mean scrum.

This may be one of the topics for you to start thinking about when you join us.
* high-level architecture - splitting various functionality into separate and meaningful (micro)services
* how to design data flows? S3? Queues? APIs?
* scalability, maintainability (developer UX), stability

## What do we expect from you

You should have quite a bit of experience
* analysing a problem, spliting it into smaller chunks and designing a process
* maintaining a larger system such as ours
* maintaining infrastructure - database, linux servers
* writing maintainable code, making development process better

We will get along if we share team values.
* Our team is open-minded, inclusive, passionate.
* We help each other and trust each other to do the best job possible.
* We are always learning and trying to stay ahead.
* We respect each other and listen to one another. 
* Creativity, passion, ambition and Outfindo goals drive us forward. We depend on each other's reliability.

## What do we offer

* money - not garage-startup money, not corporate-level money either, but we want you to be comfortable (CZK 100k+)
* stock options for you to get what is yours when Outfindo gets successful
* all the help we can provide to get you going - let us know
* regular mentoring and leadership by [Ondřej]({{ site.baseurl }}/team#ondrej), can go both ways - we can all learn from each other
* stress-free work environment - there are no "crunches", no time estimates, no hard commitments to deliver changes at certain time
* monthly team events - bike in summer, climbing in winter, off-sites

We are based in Prague with office in Žižkov.
Remote work is alright, but we prefer to see each other regularly to be effective and have some fun, more so after two years of Covid isolation.
We have good-enough office, we make good filtered coffee and we love cookies.
