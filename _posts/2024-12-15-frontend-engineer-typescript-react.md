We need help with building frontend for the best SaaS guidance app!

Join our awesome [team]({{ site.baseurl }}/team)! We are scaling our engineering right now.
The infant hacky two years of Outfindo are over, we are reasonably sure about what we need to build now.

This is an **opportunity to do things the way you want, to learn a lot**, and to be part of the formative period of our company.
If you help us to make it, there's a lot in it for you as well. **There is a challenge here waiting for you.**

## What we do

Outfindo guides a customer through the process of choosing products online - be it a bike or a bra. Our core know-how is guidance, building a conversation-like flow for the end customer. We
* onboard our customer (an e-shop), process their inventory
* build a guidance flow for them using our custom AI tech
* enhance product data to gain insights, using autonomous scrapers and LLMs
* build a guide that helps the end-customers and embed that into our partners' websites
  See [outfindo.com](https://outfindo.com).

## What will you do

* implement changes to our apps based on well-researched user stories by product manager [Adlo]({{ site.baseurl }}/team#adlo)
* create UX based on design work by our designer
* participate on product decisions during early phases of dev process - we are not a [feature factory](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory)
* pair-program and review code with [Franta]({{ site.baseurl }}/team#franta) so that you can learn from each other
* refactor the code regularly to eliminate tech debt
* ship small changes with feature toggles so that we can deploy continuously
* make architecture decisions, use new tech if it helps
* participate in team activities - learning sessions, sharing experience, workshops

## How we do it

We use this tech:
* Typescript, React, Redux, Axios, Sass (BEM)
* Symfony/Tailwind for the self-served customer onboarding process
* Git, GitHub
* Vercel for hosting our SPA app
* Sentry for monitoring
* shell scripts for task automation

We write tests, do code reviews or pair-programming, champion trunk-based development. Divide and conquer - make small things work as fast as possible. Think about the bigger picture. We do a lot of experiments. We are agile, and by that I do not mean scrum.

## What do we expect from you

We want a valuable and engaged team member. You should feel and be aligned with what value we provide as a company and act accordingly.
* collaborate closely with your team mates
* be proactive, participate in discussions when finding a solution to a problem, listen to feedback
* take ownership of tasks, be flexible with evolving needs

You should have quite a bit of tech experience as well:
* maintaining a React SPA app including architecture, API integration, data models, SSR, performance optimization
* coding components with a sense of design and UX
* bridging the gap between the design and development - translate mockups into responsive intuitive interfaces
* analysing a problem, splitting it into smaller chunks and proposing a solution
* writing maintainable code, making development process better

In a nutshell, I think you should be an experienced developer with 5 years of experience at least, focused on team-work, effectivity and delivering value for the company.

We will get along if we share team values.
* Our team is open-minded, inclusive, passionate.
* We help each other and trust each other to do the best job possible.
* We are always learning and trying to stay ahead.
* We respect each other and listen to one another.
* Creativity, passion, ambition and Outfindo goals drive us forward. We depend on each other's reliability.

This may be one of the tasks or topics for you to start thinking about when you join us.
* coding the app with the best UX for our customers
* maintaining the design system, component library, style guide
* better data models, tighter integration with e.g. OpenAPI specs
* managing quality - e.g. start setting up automated tests
* feature-toggle based architecture
* dockerization, GitHub Actions CI pipeline, better monitoring
* performance optimization, accessibility, SEO

## What do we offer

* money - not garage-startup money, not corporate-level money either, but we want you to be comfortable
* base plus bonuses tied to KPIs
* stock options for you to get what is yours when Outfindo gets successful
* all the help we can provide to get you going - let us know
* regular mentoring and leadership, knowledge sharing with the rest of the wider tech team, can go both ways - we can all learn from each other
* stress-free work environment
* monthly team events - bike in summer, climbing in winter, off-sites once or twice a year

We are based in Prague with office in Žižkov.
Remote work is alright, but we prefer to see each other regularly to be effective and have some fun. Communication is the key.
We have good-enough office, we make good filtered coffee and we love cookies.

**If this resonates with you let us know - even if you are not sure about some of this stuff or about yourself. We are ready to help you if you want to work with us.**
