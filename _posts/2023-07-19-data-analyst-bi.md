There's currently only one BI / data analytics guy doing all the work. He needs a partner!

Join our awesome [team]({{ site.baseurl }}/team)! We are scaling our operations right now.
The infant hacky three years of Outfindo are over, we are reasonably sure about what we need to build now.

This is an **opportunity to do things the way you want, to learn a lot**, and to be part of the formative period of our company.
If you help us to make it, there's a lot in it for you as well. **There is a challenge here waiting for you.**

## What we do
Outfindo helps people to choose products online - we sell our products as a SaaS to our partners and also have our own B2C platform outfindo.cz. We can connect customers and partners needs with product data. We

* obtain availability data from shops/eshops and match them with our catalog
* build a guide which helps customers to find the right product
* build a tools which we embed to our customers websites

* It is ok to not be sure about some of these things. We are all learning along the way.

## What do we offer
* money - not garage-startup money, not corporate-level money either, but we want you to be comfortable (40-60k)
* all the help we can provide to get you going - let us know
* regular mentoring and leadership by [Ondřej]({{ site.baseurl }}/team#ondrej), can go both ways - we can all learn from each other
* stress-free work environment - there are no "crunches", no time estimates, no hard commitments to deliver changes at certain time
* monthly team events - bike in summer, climbing in winter, off-sites

We are based in Prague with office in Žižkov.
Remote work is alright, but we prefer to see each other regularly to be effective and have some fun, more so after two years of Covid isolation.
We have comfy chairs, whiteboard.

**If this resonates with you let us know - even if you are not sure about some of this stuff or about yourself. We are ready to help you if you want to work with us.**
